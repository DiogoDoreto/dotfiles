#+TITLE: Flakes Modules

This folder contains modular Nix flakes that encapsulate configuration,
overlays, and modules which depend on external inputs or packages. The goal is
to keep host and shared configuration clean and decoupled from modules that
require specific upstream dependencies.

Each subfolder here should provide its own =flake.nix=, defining the necessary
inputs and exposing overlays, NixOS modules, and Home Manager modules as
outputs. Hosts can then selectively include these flakes as inputs, ensuring
that host-specific dependencies do not leak into global/shared configuration.

Use this structure for any configuration that is not universally applicable to
all hosts, but instead relies on particular external packages, overlays, or
modules.
